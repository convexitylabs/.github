# Welcome to Convexity Labs ðŸ‘‹

Convexity Labs is a seed-stage technology company improving the accessibility and reproducibility of research-grade computational biology software.

We recently raised a 3.6M USD initial funding round to launch our public platform, [LabDAO](https://github.com/labdao), and our enterprise-ready version.

Our platform [PLEX](https://github.com/labdao/plex) is an open-core software library addressing the needs of modern biotechnology, and healthcare teams by putting reproducibility, data ownership, and access tracking first.

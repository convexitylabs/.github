Convexity Labs was a early-stage technology company focused on improving the accessibility and reproducibility of research-grade computational biology software.
We were developing the [Lab Exchange](https://github.com/labdao/plex) an open-core software library addressing the needs of modern biotechnology, and healthcare teams by putting reproducibility, data ownership, and access tracking first.
